<ul>
  <li>I unwittingly became a part of hacker history when he sent me a short ciphertext e-mail, titled “S8F”.</li>
  <li>S8F is a meme from the mind of the genius Russian hacker, <code class="highlighter-rouge">‘E. Frey’ (2Cd5mXDb2n@mail.ru), ‘of BRAD a money Considered KENNETH’, 31 May 2006.</code> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Ruk0fG8dtjs_qEqJ25VcQ/about">youtube</a>)</li>
  <li>Frey send out spam emails to a large number of addresses, from addresses <code class="highlighter-rouge">@mail.ru</code> that consisted of ciphertext haikus, with 4 interspersing lines of quotes from popular fiction each.</li>
  <li>One source text was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Livingston_Seagull">Jonathan Livingston Seagull</a> (by Richard Bach), which I recognized without the help of Google (I had read the book as a child) and the other was something unknown, referring to “canisters”, a “map”, and a “window”.</li>
  <li>After receiving the e-mail in 2006 (sent to my address at the time, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;finalreflector@gmail.com&gt;</code>, I immediately sensed that something was wrong, and saved it to my Starred Inbox.</li>
  <li>It appeared to be garbled nonsense, it had evaded my spam filter, AND it seemed like some Zen haiku poem from the future. I was intrigued.</li>
  <li>I registered the domain <code class="highlighter-rouge">S8F.org</code>, in anticipation of one day putting the puzzle all together.</li>
  <li>On June 8th 2018, finally I did some sleuthing and arrived back at the source: Mr. Frey.</li>
  <li>Finally, I can say that I have connected one of the most obscure messages in history, to its ultimate origin, and I am struggling to comprehend how this all happened in the first place. It’s like a time-loop from science fiction, only this is real life. Or is it?</li>
  <li>I will continue S8F as a hacker collective and look forward to working with the cipherpunk community.</li>
  <li>Cheers!</li>

<p>Full text of the passage from <em>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Part Two</h4>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is heaven, he thought, and he had to smile at himself. It was
hardly respectful to analyze heaven in the very moment that one  flies  up
to enter it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he came from Earth now, above the clouds and  in  close  formation
with the two brilliant gulls, he saw that his  own  body  was  growing  as
bright as theirs. True, the same young Jonathan Seagull was there that had
always lived behind his golden eyes, but the outer form had changed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It felt like a seagull body, but alreadv it flew far better than  his
old one had ever flown. Why, with half the effort, he  thought,  I'll  get
twice the speed, twice the performance of my best days on Earth!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His feathers glowed brilliant white now, and his  wings  were  smooth
and perfect as sheets of polished silver. He began, delightedly, to  learn
about them, to press power into these new wings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At two hundred fifty mlles per hour he felt that he was  nearing  his
level-flight maximum speed. At two hundred seventy-three he  thought  that
he was flying as fast as  he  could  fly,  and  he  was  ever  so  faintly
disappointed. There was a limit to how much the new  body  could  do,  and
though it was much faster than his old level-flight record, it was still a
limit that would take great effort to crack. In heaven, he thought,  there
should be no limits.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  clouds  broke  apart,  his  escorts  called,  "Happy   landings,
Jonathan," and vanished into thin air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was flying over a sea, toward  a  jagged  shoreline.  A  very  few
seagulls were working the updrafts on the cliffs. Away off to  the  north,
at the horizon itself, flew a few others. New sights,  new  thoughts,  new
questions. Why so few gulls? Heaven should be flocked with gulls! And  why
am I so tired, all at once? Gulls in  heaven  are  never  supposed  to  be
tired, or to sleep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where had he heard that? The memory of his life on Earth was  falling
away. Earth had been a place where he had learned much, of course, but the
details were blurred -  something  about  fighting  for  food,  and  being
Outcast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozen gulls by the shoreline came to  meet  him,  none  saying  a
word. He felt only that he was welcome and that this was home. It had been
a bigday for him, a day whose sunrise he no longer remembered.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to land on the beach, beating his wings to stop an inch  in
the air, then dropping lightly to the sand, The other  gulls  landed  too,
but not one of them so much as flapped a  feather.  They  swung  into  the
wind, bright wings outstretched, then somehow they changed  the  curve  of
their feathers until they had stopped  in  the  same  instant  their  feet
touched the ground. It was beautiful control, but now  Jonathan  was  just
too tired to try it. Standiug there on the beach,  still  without  a  word
spoken, he was asleep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days that followed, Jonathan saw that there  was  as  much  to
learn about flight in this place as there had been in the life behind him.
But with a difference. Here were gulls who thought as he thought, For each
of them, the most important thing in living was to  reach  out  and  touch
perfection in that which they most loved to do, and that was to fly.  They
were magnificent birds, all of them, and they spent hour after hour  every
day practicing flight, testing advanced aeronautics.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time Jonathan forgot about the  world  that  he  had  come
from, that place where the Flock lived with its eyes tightly shut  to  the
joy of flight, using its wings as means to the end of finding and fighting
for food. But now and then, just for a moment, he remembered.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered it one morning when he was  out  with  his  instructor,
while they rested on the beach after a session of folded-wing snap rolls.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is everybody, Sullivan?" he asked silently, quite at home  now
with the easy telepathy that  these  gulls  used  instead  of  screes  and
gracks. "Why aren't there more of us here? Why, where I  came  from  there
were.. "

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... thousands and thousands of gulls. I know. " Sullivan  shook  his
head. "The only answer I can see, Jonathan, is that you are pretty well  a
<strong><big><code>one-in-a-million bird. Most of us came along ever so slowly. We went  from</code></big></strong>
one world into another that was almost exactly like it,  forgettiug  right
away where we had come from, not caring where we were headed,  living  for
the moment. Do you have any idea how many lives we must have gone  through
before we even gor the first idea that there is more to life than  eating,
or fighting, or power in the Flock? A thousand lives, Jon,  ten  thousand!
And then another hundred lives until we began to learn that there is  such
a thing as perfection, and another hundred again to get the idea that  our
purpose for living is to find that perfection and show it forth. The  same
rule holds for us now, of course: we choose our next world through what we
learn in this one. Learn nothing, and the next world is the same  as  this
one, all the same limitations and lead weights to overcome."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched his wings and turned to face the wind. "But  you,  Jon,"
he said, "learned so much at one time that you didn't have to go through a
thousand lives to reach this one."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment they  were  airborne  again,  practicing.  The  formation
point-roils were difficult, for through the inverted half Jonathan had  to
think upside down, reversing the curve  of  his  wing,  and  reversing  it
exactly in harmony with his instructor's.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's try it again." Sullivan said over  and  over:  "Let's  try  it
again." Then, finally, "Good." And they began practicing outside loops.

<center>........................................</center>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One evening the gulls that were not night-flying  stood  together  on
the sand, thinking. Jonathan took all his courage in hand  and  walked  to
the Elder Gull, who, it was said, was soon to be moving beyond this world.
"Chiang..." he said a little nervously.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old seagull looked at him kindly. "Yes, my son?" Instead of being
enfeebled by age, the Elder had been empowered by it; he could outfly  any
gull in the Flock, and he had learned skills that  the  others  were  only
gradually coming to know.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chiang, this world isn't heaven at all, is it?" The Elder smiled  in
the moonlight. "You are learning again, Jonathan Seagull," he said.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, what happens from here? Where are we going? Is there  no  such
place as heaven?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Jonathan, there is no such place. Heaven is not a place, and  it
is not a time. Heaven is being perfect." He was silent for a moment.  "You
are a very fast flier, aren't you?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... I enjoy speed," Jonathan said, taken aback but proud  that  the
Elder had noticed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will begin to touch heaven, Jonathan, in  the  moment  that  you
touch perfect speed. And that isn't flying a thousand miles an hour, or  a
million, or flying at the speed of light. Because any number is  a  limit,
and perfection doesn't have  limits.  Perfect  speed,  my  son,  is  being
there."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without warning, Chiang vanished and appeared  at  the  water's  edge
fifty feet away, all in the flicker of an instant. Then he vanished  again
and stood, in the same millisecond, at Jonathan's shoulder. "It's kind  of
fun," he said.

<center>........................................</center>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan was dazzled. He forgot to ask about heaven. "How do  you  do
that? What does it feel like? How far can you go?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can go to any place and to any time that you wish  to  go,"  the
Elder said. "I've gone everywhere and everywhen I can think of." He looked
across the sea. "It's strange. The gulls who scorn perfection for the sake
of travel go nowhere, slowly. Those who put aside travel for the  sake  of
perfection go anywhere, instantly.  Remember,  Jonathan,  heaven  isn't  a
place or a time, because place and time are so  very  meaningless.  Heaven
is..."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you teach me to fly like that?"  Jonathan  Seagull  trembled  to
conquer another unknown.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course if you wish to learn."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish. When can we start?".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We could start now if you'd like."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to learn to fly like that," Jonathan said and a strange light
glowed in his eyes. "Tell me what to do,"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiang spoke slowly and watched the younger gull ever  so  carefully.
"To fly as fast as thought, to anywhere that is," he said, "you must begin
by knowing that you have already arrived ..."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trick, according to Chiang,  was  for  Jonathan  to  stop  seeing
himself as trapped inside  a  limited  body  that  had  a  forty-two  inch
wingspan and performance that could be plotted on a chart. The  trick  was
to know that his true nature lived, as perfect  as  an  unwritten  number,
everywhere at once across space and time.

........................................

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan kept at it, fiercely, day after  day,  from  before  sunrise
till past midnight. And for all his effort he moved not  a  feather  width
from his spot.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forget about faith!" Chiang said it time and again. "You didn't need
faith to fly, you needed to understand flying.This is jast the  same.  Now
try again ..."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then one day Jonathan, standing  on  the  shore,  closing  his  eyes,
concentrating, all in a flash knew what Chiang had been telling him. "Why,
that's true! I am a perfect, unlimited gull!" He felt  a  great  shock  of
joy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" said Chiang and there was victory in his voice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan opened his eyes. He stood alone with the Elder on a  totally
different seashore - trees down to the  water's  edge,  twin  yellow  suns
turning overhead.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At last you've got the idea," Chiang said, "but your control needs a
little work... "

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan was stunned. "Where are we?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utterly unimpressed with the strange surroundings, the Elder  brushed
the question aside. "We're on some planet, obviously, with a green sky and
a double star for a sun."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan made a scree of delight, the first sound he had  made  since
he had left Earth. "IT WORKS!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, of course, it works, Jon." said Chiang. "It always works, when
you know what you're doing. Now about your control..."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time they returned, it was dark. The  other  gulls  looked  at
Jonathan with awe in their golden eyes, for they had  seen  him  disappear
from where he had been rooted for so long.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood their congratulations for  less  than  a  minute.  "I'm  the
newcomer here! I'm just beginning! It is I who must learn from you!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder about that, Jon," said Sullivan standing  near.  "You  have
less fear of learning than any gull I've seen in ten thousand years.  "The
Flock fell silent, and Jonathan fidgeted in embarrassment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can start working with time if you wish," Chiang said, "till  you
can fly the past and the future. And then you will be ready to  begin  the
most difficult, the most powerful, the most fun of all. You will be  ready
to begin to fly up and know the meaning of kindness and of love."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month went by, or something that  felt  about  like  a  month,  and
Jonathan learned at a tremendous rate. He always had learned quickly  from
ordinary experience, and now, the special student of the Elder Himself, he
took in new ideas like a streamlined feathered computer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then the day came that  Chiang  vanished.  He  had  been  talking
quietly with them all, exhorting them never to  stop  their  learning  and
their practicing and their striving to  understand  more  of  the  perfect
invisible principle of all life. Then, as  he  spoke,  his  feathers  went
brighter and brighter and at last turned so brilliant that no  gull  could
look upon him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jonathan," he said, and these were the last  words  that  he  spoke,
"keep working on love."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they could see again, Chiang was gone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the days went past, Jonathan found himself thinking time and again
of the Earth from which he had come. If he had known there just  a  tenth,
just a hundredth, of what he knew here, how  much  more  life  would  have
meant! He stood on the sand and fell to wondering if there was a gull back
there who might be struggling to break out  of  his  limits,  to  see  the
meaning of flight beyond a way of  travel  to  get  a  breadcrumb  from  a
rowboat. Perhaps there might even have been one made Outcast for  speaking
his truth in the face of the Flock. And the more  Jonathan  practiced  his
kindness lessons, and the more he worked to know the nature of  love,  the
more he wanted to go back to Earth. For  in  spite  of  his  lonely  past,
Jonathan Seagull was born  to  be  an  instructor,  and  his  own  way  of
demonstrating love was to give something of the truth that he had seen  to
a gull who asked only a chance to see truth for himself.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sullivan, adept now at thought-speed flight and helping the others to
learn, was doubrful.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jon, you were Outcast once. Why do you think that any of  the  gulls
in your old time would listen to you now? You know the proverb,  and  it's
true: The gull sees farthest who flies highest. Those gulls where you came
from are standing on the ground, squawking and fighting among  themselves.
They're a thousand miles from heaven - and you say you want to  show  them
heaven from where they stand! Jon, they can't see their own wingtips! Stay
here. Help the new gulls here, the ones who are high enough  to  see  what
you have to tell them." He was quiet for a moment, and then he said, "What
if Chiang had gone back to his old  worlds?  Where  would  you  have  been
today?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point was the telling one, and Sullivan was right  The  gull
sees farthest who flies highest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan stayed and worked with the new birds coming in, who were all
very bright and quick with their lessons. But the old feeling  came  back,
<strong><big><code>and he couldn't help but think that there might be one or two  gulls  back</code></big></strong>
on Earth who would be able to learn, too. How  much  more  would  he  have
known by now if Chiang had come to him on the day that he was Outcast!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sully, I must go back " he said at last  "Your  students  are  doing
well. They can help you bring the newcomers along."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sullivan sighed, but he did  not  argue.  "I  think  I'll  miss  you,
Jonathan," was all he said.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sully, for shame!" Jonathan said in reproach, "and don't be foolish!
What are we trying to practice every day? If  our  friendship  depends  on
things like space and time, then when we finally overcome space and  time,
we've destroyed our own brotherhood! But overcome space, and all  we  have
left is Here. Overcome time, and all we have  left  is  Now.  And  in  the
middle of Here and Now, don't you think that we might see each other  once
or twice?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sullivan Seagull laughed in spite of himself. "You  crazy  bird,"  he
said kindly. "If anybody can show someone on  the  ground  how  to  see  a
thousand miles, it will be Jonathan Livingston Seagull." He looked at  the
sand. "Good-bye, Jon, my friend."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good bye, Sully. We'll meet again." And with that, Jonathan held  in
thought an image of the great gull flocks on the shore  of  another  time,
and he knew with practiced ease that he was not bone  and  feather  but  a
perfect idea of freedom and flight, limited by nothing at all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fletcher Lynd Seagull was still quite young, but already he knew that
no bird had ever been so harshly treated by any Flock,  or  with  so  much
injustice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't care what they say," he thought  fiercely,  and  his  vision
blurred as he flew out toward the Far Cliffs. "There's  so  much  more  to
flying than just flapping around from place to place! A...  a...  mosquito
does that! One little barrel roll around the Elder Gull, just for fun, and
I'm Outcast! Are they blind? Can't they see? Can't they think of the glory
that it'll be when we really learn to fly?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't care what they think. I'll show them what flying is! I'll be
pure Outlaw, if that's the way  they  want  it.  And  I'll  make  them  so
sorry..."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice came inside his own head, and though it was very gentle, it
startled him so much that he faltered and stumbled in the air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be harsh on them, Fletcher Seagull. In casting  you  out,  the
other gulls have only hurt themselves, and one day they  will  know  this,
and one day they will see what you see. Forgive them,  and  help  them  to
understand."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An inch from his right wingtip flew the most brilliant white gull  in
all the world, gliding effortlessly along, not moving a feather,  at  what
was very nearly Fletcher's top speed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a moment of chaos in the young bird. "What's going on? Am I
mad? Am I dead? What is this?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low and calm, the voice went on  within  his  thought,  demanding  an
answer. "Fletcher Lynd Seagull, do you want to fly?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"YES, I WANT TO FLY!".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fletcher Lynd Seagull, do you want to fly  so  much  that  you  will
forgive the Flock, and learn, and go back to them one day and work to help
them know?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no lying to this magniflcent skillful being, no matter  how
proud or how hurt a bird was Fletcher Seagull.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I do " he said softly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then, Fletch," that bright creature said to him, and the  voice  was
very kind, "let's begin with Level Flight...."

<p>Recently just before the 12th anniversary of the e-mail, I had a retrospective in `#bot18` Discord chat:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[8:01 PM] LoneWolf345: Off topic question.  What is the significance of the 8f in your screen name?  Is it supposed to be pronounced?
[8:02 PM] carlos8f: ha. i like when people ask me that
[8:02 PM] LoneWolf345: Or is it a hex number?
[8:02 PM] carlos8f: just a minute
[8:02 PM] carlos8f: i used to explain it on my website
[8:02 PM] carlos8f: but the website's been down for a while
[8:15 PM] carlos8f: @LoneWolf345 ok, here you go :smile: https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/916687a81a6232981af601f362a7640e
Gist
S8F.md
S8F.md

[8:17 PM] LoneWolf345: Fun
[8:17 PM] carlos8f: yep, I have no idea who sent me that email
[8:18 PM] carlos8f: it's the greatest mystery of my life
[8:18 PM] carlos8f: like, what were they even trying to do?
[8:19 PM] carlos8f: quote jonathan livingston seagull and cross it with something about cannisters?
[8:19 PM] carlos8f: LOL
[8:19 PM] carlos8f: and why S8F as the subject
[8:19 PM] carlos8f: i will never know.
[8:19 PM] LoneWolf345: My profile pic say “stupid as a rat”.  It was something an old roommate called once when he was mad.  Never heard of that before so I decided to embrace it.  Paid to have a logo made, started a website for all my experimental stuff, all that fun.
[8:20 PM] LoneWolf345: That was so many years ago but it still my gravatar
[8:20 PM] Crankshaw: lol email.  they were probably just seeing what emails existed out there. checking for bounces (or the lack of)
[8:20 PM] carlos8f: lol, sounds like a cynical motto
[8:21 PM] carlos8f: i can understand checking for bounces, but why did they have to get CREATIVE lol
[8:21 PM] carlos8f: it makes no sense
[8:21 PM] Crankshaw: yeah lol
[8:21 PM] carlos8f: some genius hacker probably that has autism and can't formulate sentences
[8:22 PM] Crankshaw: maybe they ran some books through a markov chain thing and used it instead of lorem ipsum
[8:22 PM] Crankshaw: might have been to avoid spam filters
[8:22 PM] Crankshaw: but uhh, not sure why they would need to
[8:22 PM] carlos8f: yeah, but there was no URL in the email!
[8:22 PM] carlos8f: WTF! what are they baiting me with!
[8:22 PM] Crankshaw: yeah, it's all rather odd
[8:22 PM] carlos8f: this is a new category of spam entirely
[8:22 PM] carlos8f: it's the kind of spam that is more like performance art
[8:22 PM] Crankshaw: seemingly for no reason at all
[8:23 PM] Crankshaw: maybe s8f was a sequence id
[8:23 PM] Crankshaw: and you need to find all the others
[8:23 PM] Crankshaw: and put them together
[8:23 PM] Crankshaw: and only then will the world see what the real message is
[8:23 PM] carlos8f: maybe, a hacker wrote a script that sends those random fucked up emails from EVERY server he conquers in his botnet...
[8:23 PM] Crankshaw: ohhh, interesting theory.  could be a form of stenography
[8:24 PM] Crankshaw: one of the mass emails will be to a specific address and contain a specific random phrase
[8:24 PM] carlos8f: the trippy part, was when i was re-reading  jonathan livingston seagull randomly, and I found the passage that matched the email i was so puzzled about! i was like, MIND BLOWN
[8:24 PM] Crankshaw: haha
[8:25 PM] carlos8f: it was like real-world da-vinci code
[8:25 PM] carlos8f: they picked a really obscure book, and i happened to read it AFTER I got the email
[8:25 PM] carlos8f: and happened to recognize the passage
[8:25 PM] carlos8f: even though it was garbled in the email
[8:26 PM] brucetus: haha that email
[8:26 PM] carlos8f: it's from russia or something
[8:26 PM] Crankshaw: so many different email addresses in the headers lol
[8:26 PM] carlos8f: i'm pretty sure it was the mischief of some genius russian hacker :stuck_out_tongue:
[8:27 PM] carlos8f: who was attacking and blacklisting all his kills to death for the fun of it
[8:27 PM] Crankshaw: I need to google "The Bat!" now
[8:27 PM] carlos8f: yeah, that is one of the funniest details of the whle thing
[8:27 PM] carlos8f: what is "the bat"? LOL
[8:28 PM] Crankshaw: oh it's just an email client as it turns out
[8:28 PM] Crankshaw: like eudora
[8:28 PM] Crankshaw: https://www.ritlabs.com/en/products/thebat/
The Bat! - Secure Desktop Email Client for Windows 10
The Bat! is a secure desktop email client for Windows, designed to protect your correspondence against third-parties and to save your time.
[8:30 PM] carlos8f: oh geez, this is totally a crypto hacker
[8:30 PM] carlos8f: he's using end to end!!!
[8:30 PM] carlos8f: almost no one uses that with email
[8:31 PM] carlos8f: certainly not in 2006
[8:31 PM] carlos8f: ferdinand brandon is some kind of alias
[8:31 PM] carlos8f: i wish i could meet that guy
[8:32 PM] carlos8f: ok, so if it's just a regular email client, why was he targeting a whole list of addresses?
[8:32 PM] carlos8f: wouldn't a spammer use custom software to send the emails?
[8:32 PM] Crankshaw: yeah it's all rather odd.  possibly just a spoofed header though
[8:32 PM] Crankshaw: or an infected pc that used an installed "The Bat!"
[8:33 PM] carlos8f: why choose the  Bat as the spoofed client
[8:33 PM] Crankshaw: could've just called the "send an email" thing and that was the registered app for it
[8:33 PM] carlos8f: possibly
[8:33 PM] Crankshaw: ahh, fuck knows lol.
[8:33 PM] Crankshaw: it's all so strange
[8:33 PM] carlos8f: but, then they would get their IP blacklisted immediately
[8:33 PM] carlos8f: the logic totally eludes me
[8:34 PM] Crankshaw: yeah, wtf
[8:35 PM] carlos8f: anyway, that's what carlos8f comes from :smiley:
[8:35 PM] carlos8f: now you know the lore
[8:36 PM] carlos8f: coming up on the 12 year anniversary
[8:36 PM] carlos8f: i should re-launch s8f.org
[8:55 PM] LoneWolf345: Nice
[8:55 PM] LoneWolf345: Glad I asked
May 16, 2018
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thus, I made a portmanteau out of my name, <code class="highlighter-rouge">carloS8F</code>.</p>

<p>I have come to pronounce S8F as “safe”, and have used the domain s8f.org for all things experimental.</p>

<p>I usually pronounce “carlos8f” as “Carlos ehh-t eff” but since I prounce S8F as “safe”, I should probably be saying “Carlo-seyf”.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
