  <blockquote>
  <p>Essentially, at some point a decision was made to anchor trust in an organization like Comodo, and now we’re locked into trusting them — <em>forever</em>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://moxie.org/blog/ssl-and-the-future-of-authenticity/">Moxie Marlinspike</a></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The trust we put in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">Certificate Authorities</a> is highly underestimated in today’s online world. This is because TLS on the modern web is based on a <strong>broken model of trust.</strong> There is <a href="https://moxie.org/blog/ssl-and-the-future-of-authenticity/">no trust agility</a>, and this spells doom for everyone. In this article I’ll try to explain how and why.</p>

<h3 id="but-why-not-trust-ssl-it-says-green-lock--in-my-browser-so-its-secure-right">But why not trust SSL? It says <span style="color:green">green lock <i class="fas fa-lock"></i></span> in my browser so it’s secure, right?</h3>

<p>Not really.</p>

<h3 id="amazon-uses-it-and-so-do-all-the-big-companies-so-its-secure">Amazon uses it, and so do all the big companies. So it’s secure.</h3>

<p>Still no. Let’s take Amazon as an example:</p>

<p><img src="/files/amazon_cert.png" alt="amazon cert issed by Symantec" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>You trust Amazon.com with your credit card to buy socks. Because you <strong>need</strong> socks.</li>
  <li>Maybe you did your homework and looked at Amazon.com’s address bar, which showed a <span style="color:green">green lock <i class="fas fa-lock"></i></span> and that looks nice and secure, so “I know I can trust that <strong>no man-in-the-middle got my credit card #</strong>”</li>
  <li>If you looked a little deeper, you’d see that Amazon’s cert is issued by <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symantec">Symantec</a></strong>. They do antivirus software, so that should be <strong>fine</strong>, right?</li>
  <li>Except certs can change at any time. The next day, Amazon starts using one issued by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comodo_Group">Comodo</a>, because they’re <strong>cheaper</strong>. Win for everyone?</li>
  <li>You go back to Amazon.com and buy more socks, only this time it’s a <strong>Comodo</strong> cert feeding your TLS connection.</li>
  <li>You soon get a call from your bank, saying your credit card was <strong>cancelled</strong> and a new one was issued in the mail. They cited “suspicious activity” as the cause. <strong>What the heck</strong>?</li>
  <li>Then you read in the news that <strong>some hacker</strong> issued some rogue certs for Amazon.com. <strong>Big deal right?</strong></li>
  <li>The hacker set up some <strong>DNS spoofing</strong> that pointed your Coffee Shop internet connection to <strong>193.293.20.10</strong> (evil server), presenting a “valid” SSL cert, actually issued by <strong>Comodo</strong>. Comodo is trusted by browsers, so your browser didn’t even notice that it’s talking to <strong>evil server</strong> and not directly to Amazon.</li>
  <li>They proxied your requests to the real Amazon.com, so YOU didn’t even notice, and for fun they also <strong>extracted your CC number</strong>, Amazon password, email address, and mail address to their <strong>evil server</strong>.</li>
  <li>SSL didn’t protect you, it only <strong>misled you</strong> into (ultimately) trusting a compromised trust chain.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="but-what-if-comodo-is-now-hack-proof-and-they-revoked-the-bad-certs-and-theyre-fully-trustable-again">But what if Comodo is now hack-proof and they revoked the bad certs and they’re fully trustable again?</h3>

<p>Sure. But their root CA cert is still <strong>trusted by default</strong> in major browsers. That means <strong>ANY certs</strong> they create will be trusted by everyone.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-that-a-problem-i-trust-comodo">Why is that a problem? I trust Comodo…</h3>

<p>What if they wanted to <strong>MITM your Amazon.com session</strong> for their own purposes? Easy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Comodo creates their <strong>OWN certs</strong> for <span style="color:green">Amazon.com <i class="fas fa-lock"></i></span>, Comodo owning the private key.</li>
  <li>Comodo sets up <strong>evil proxies</strong> that use that cert and forward to the real Amazon.com</li>
  <li>Comodo now <strong>owns</strong> your “encrypted” SSL traffic to Amazon.com</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="i-dont-believe-comodo-would-be-that-evil">I don’t believe Comodo would be that evil.</h3>

<p>Well, for a start:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2887632/secure-advertising-tool-privdog-compromises-https-security.html">bundled malware into their downloads</a> called PrivDog, claiming to protect users, but actually enabling a MITM attack.</li>
  <li>They <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=704">disabled same-origin security</a> in their custom browser, effectively enabling arbitrary MITM attacks.</li>
  <li>They <a href="http://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/comodo-continue-to-to-issue-certificates-to-known-malware-343022/">continued issuing certs used in malware</a>.</li>
  <li>They declared <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2016/06/23/defending-our-brand.html">trademark war on Let’s Encrypt</a> for “stealing” the idea of the “90-day free SSL”.</li>
  <li>Their CEO is a <a href="https://twitter.com/feross/status/746102800531128320">bit of a douche</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For background, Comodo has a <strong>monopoly</strong> on SSL certs:</p>

<p><img src="/files/ca_market_share.png" alt="ca market share" /></p>

<h3 id="but-why-would-a-company-with-a-40-market-share-do-this">But why would a company with a 40% market share do this?</h3>

<p>Comodo sees <a href="https://forums.comodo.com/general-discussion-off-topic-anything-and-everything/shame-on-you-comodo-t115958.0.html;msg837411#msg837411">Lets Encrypt as threat</a> to their monopoly on “90-day free SSL”. Comodo is not free though, it costs roughly <strong>$20-90</strong> for a low-level cert. Let’s Encrypt is <strong>free forever</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="why-would-lets-encrypt-want-to-offer-something-for-free-i-want-to-pay-money-in-exchange-for-trust-like-i-do-in-other-industries">Why would Lets Encrypt want to offer something for free? I want to pay money in exchange for trust, like I do in other industries.</h3>

<p>That’s where they got you. SSL <strong>should</strong> be free, because privacy should be a right, and SSL is critical for privacy. Further, introducing a middle-man (Comodo in this case) compromises your privacy, as shown above. Comodo doesn’t even <strong>verify that you own the domain</strong>, instead it requires you to respond to an email sent to <code class="highlighter-rouge">webmaster@yourdomain.com</code> or similar. It takes roughly 20 mins to set up.</p>

<p>By contrast, Lets Encrypt does <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/">real domain validation</a> using a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-02">new, open protocol</a> called ACME. Since the whole process can be automated, human intervention (and thus the CA industry) is <strong>rendered redundant</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="well-as-long-as-i-dont-buy-a-comodo-cert-im-fine-right">Well, as long as I don’t buy a Comodo cert I’m fine, right?</h3>

<p>Not exactly. If 40% of the web uses Comodo, that makes <strong>40% of the web compromisable by the same hacker</strong>, by hacking a single crypto (root CA) keypair. That is super dangerous for the entire internet. In truth, Comodo has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comodo_Group#Certificate_hacking">already been hacked</a>, and will probably be hacked again.</p>

<h3 id="ok-i-give-up-ill-just-use-cloudflare-to-secure-and-accelerate-my-site">OK I give up. I’ll just use CloudFlare to secure and accelerate my site.</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a> specializes in <strong>security</strong> and performance. Thus, they offer a service that <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/overview/">“protects and accelerates”</a> your website. Oh, and they also register a Comodo cert and use it for your domain:</p>

<p><img src="/files/cloudflare_cert.png" alt="cloudflare cert" /></p>

<h3 id="wait-doesnt-that-mean-they-are-mitm-ing-my-sites-visitors">Wait, doesn’t that mean they are MITM-ing my site’s visitors?</h3>

<p>Yes! It does. Both <strong>CloudFlare</strong> (who owns the cert private keys) and <strong>Comodo</strong> (who can issue any cert) are trusted by all browsers. But why is the trust there? Because of the <strong>CA industry</strong>, and its influence on browser makers.</p>

<h3 id="i-still-trust-wellsfargocom-to-do-my-online-banking-and-they-use-a-symantec-cert">I still trust WellsFargo.com to do my online banking, and they use a Symantec cert.</h3>

<p>Glad you did your homework, but remember, <strong>at any time</strong> Wells Fargo could start using a Comodo cert, or even include <strong>a single JS file</strong> on their site hosted on <strong>CloudFlare</strong>. If CloudFlare gets compromised (or, inclusively, Comodo), your bank password could be extracted through browser-js injection. Literally any JS file included on any site could exfiltrate passwords or other sensitive data, even if the connection is “end-to-end encrypted with TLS perfect forward secrecy”, as people like to say these days.</p>

<h3 id="cant-we-remove-comodo-from-the-list-of-trusted-cas">Can’t we remove Comodo from the list of trusted CA’s?</h3>

<p>Maybe, but so many sites were lured into using Comodo because of <strong>low prices</strong>, that 40% of the web would break if Firefox and Google started blacklisting their certs. And of course, we know that <strong>web users hate it</strong> when stuff breaks, so web companies (and the web at large) generally won’t risk breaking changes. That spells doom for the <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2016/05/16/agility.html">Cryptographic Agility</a> of the web.</p>

<h3 id="oh-great-what-now">Oh great. What now?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Use <span style="color:green">Let’s Encrypt <i class="fas fa-lock"></i></span> (or <a href="https://www.digicert.com/">DigiCert</a>, if you have the money). It’s free and only takes 10 minutes to switch.</li>
  <li>The catch is that <code class="highlighter-rouge">certbot</code> <strong>could</strong> middle-man your server.</li>
  <li>We need to make sure Let’s Encrypt stays <strong>open</strong>, free, and peer-reviewed. Eventually, perhaps SSL certs will be issued for a small fee by the government(s), for <strong>public privacy and security</strong>.</li>
  <li>Then, and only then, can we stop the Comodo monopoly future <strong>trust breakdown apocalypse</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/files/no_comodo.png" alt="image" /></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>As of today, I’m proud to say I’m <strong>no longer</strong> a Comodo customer, and <a href="https://s8f.org/">s8f.org</a> now runs on a <span style="color:green">Let’s Encrypt <i class="fas fa-lock"></i></span> cert.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Zenbot is a lightweight, extendable, artificially intelligent trading bot. Currently Zenbot is capable of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>High-frequency trading, day trading, week trading</li>
  <li>Multiple asset support for Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin (and more)</li>
  <li>Multiple currency support for US Dollars, Euros, Chinese Yuan (and more)</li>
  <li>Multiple exchange support for Bitfinex, GDAX, Kraken, Poloniex (and more)</li>
  <li>Realtime consuming and analysis of trade data</li>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/38a9dd292c7ce4d4425803e9548f7960">Backtesting your trade strategy</a></li>
  <li>Outputting data as <a href="https://zenbot.s8f.org/data.csv">CSV</a>, <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/carlos8f/38a9dd292c7ce4d4425803e9548f7960/raw/sim_result.json">JSON</a>, or <a href="https://zenbot.s8f.org/">candlestick graph</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>Current simulations on historical data from May - August 2016 show Zenbot 3.5.13 making a <a href="https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/c600abb8b984eae31ff770aa2ee0ad68">1.720 ROI</a> in only 3 months, using default parameters!</p>

<p><em>Zenbot is a genius!</em></p>

<p>HOWEVER. BE AWARE that once you hook up Zenbot to a live exchange, the damage done is your fault, not mine! <strong>As with buying crypto currency in general, risk is involved and caution is essential. Crypto currency is an experiment, and so is Zenbot.</strong></p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A powerful map/reduce system to live-process data at scale.</li>
  <li>A plugin system to facilitate incremental support for any exchange, currency pair, trade strategy, or reporting medium.</li>
  <li>Out of the box, Zenbot is an AI-powered trade advisor (gives you buy or sell signals while watching live data).</li>
  <li>Default support for <a href="https://gdax.com/">GDAX</a> is included, so if you have a GDAX account, enable bot trades by simply putting your GDAX API key in <code class="highlighter-rouge">config.js</code> and setting what currency pair to trade.</li>
  <li>Default support for other exchanges is ongoing.</li>
  <li>Trade strategy is fully exposed in the config file. This allows you to have full control over the bot’s actions and logic. For example, instead of trading on GDAX, you could trade on a different exchange or currency pair by implementing a few lines of JavaScript.</li>
  <li>A live candlestick graph is provided via a built-in HTTP server.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re having an error on Windows and you’re about to give up, it’s probably because Node.js is generally broken on Windows and you should try running on a Linux docker container or a Mac instead.</p>

<p>If you’re still insistent on using Windows, you’ll have to fork zenbot, fix it yourself, and I’ll accept a Pull Request.</p>

  <li>Holds for min. 100 minutes after a trade</li>
</ul>

<p>You can tweak the JS from there to use bitfinex, or trade ETH, or whatever. After tweaking <code class="highlighter-rouge">default_logic.js</code>, Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">./zenbot sim</code> to check your strategy against historical trades.</p>

<p>Note that simulations always end on Wednesday 5pm PST, and run for a max 84 days (12 weeks), to ensure input consistency.</p>

<p>Auto-learn support and more exchange support will come soon. Will accept PR’s :) With the 3.x plugin architecture, external plugins are possible too (published as their own repo/module).</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="update-tips">Update Tips</h3>

<p>To update your Zenbot installation, use <code class="highlighter-rouge">./update.sh</code>. If you have merge conflicts after update, solve them, then run <code class="highlighter-rouge">./run.sh</code>. If you have runtime JavaScript errors after update, your database might be obsolete. Try dropping your <code class="highlighter-rouge">zenbrain</code> DB and run <code class="highlighter-rouge">run.sh</code> again to start with a clean state.</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3 id="can-i-use-zenbot-3-with-x-exchange">Can I use Zenbot 3 with [X] exchange?</h3>

<p>Yes! As long as that exchange has a public API, you can find a plugin (or write one) to interact with that exchange. I accept pull requests if you want to contribute [X] exchange support.</p>

<h3 id="why-open-source">Why open source?</h3>

<p>There is a general lack of open source bots, especially ones with AI. Since I learned how to code by reverse engineering, I publish code so others can do the same, and by doing so I’m saying thanks to Satoshi, Torvalds, djb, et. al for devoting their lives to open source. It might be against my “selfish interest” but in the end it’s best for everyone. Plus, I still own the copyright.</p>

<h3 id="were-there-any-incidents-when-the-bots-trade-made-a-loss">Were there any incidents when the bot’s trade made a loss?</h3>

<p>I have seen losses in the simulator, so it’s possible. It only takes a few minutes of machine learning to gain a comfortable (albeit virtual) profit margin though. If the bot starts losing money, you can always step in and manual trade or shut the bot down to prevent more loss.</p>

<h3 id="based-on-what-criteria-does-the-bot-decide-to-close-a-trade">Based on what criteria does the bot decide to close a trade?</h3>

<p>zenbot always trades with the “market” flag, i.e. the order never goes on the books, and the trade goes through with whatever price the last system trade was at. This way, zenbot never needs to cancel orders or compare prices.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-trader-not-enough-funds-mean">What does [trader] not enough funds mean?</h3>

<p>It means the bot tried to buy or sell, but had not enough asset or currency balance to do that. If you feel comfortable investing, you can deposit asset or currency in your account and Zenbot will use that the next time the trade signal triggers.</p>

<h2 id="reading-assignment-systematic-trading-using-neural-networks">Reading assignment: Systematic trading using neural networks</h2>

<p>In mathematical terms, Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are universal function approximators, meaning that given the right data and configured correctly, they can capture and model any input-output relationships. This removes the need for human interpretation of charts to determine entry/exit signals.</p>

<p>As ANNs are essentially non-linear statistical models, their accuracy and prediction capabilities can be both mathematically and empirically tested. In various studies, authors have claimed that neural networks used for generating trading signals given various technical and fundamental inputs have significantly outperformed buy-hold strategies as well as traditional linear technical analysis methods when combined with rule-based expert systems.</p>

<p>While the advanced mathematical nature of such adaptive systems has kept neural networks for financial analysis mostly within academic research circles, in recent years more user friendly neural network software has made the technology more accessible to traders.</p>
