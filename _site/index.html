<h2 id="the-machine-learning-investment-appliance">The Machine-learning Investment Appliance</h2>

<p>By Carlos Rodriguez <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;carlos@S8F.org&gt;</code>, June 5th 2018.</p>

<h2 id="decrypting-a-message-from-the-future">Decrypting A Message from the Future…</h2>

<p>It’s the future, and we no longer have day jobs. We have ROBOTS that create and maintain Automated
Investments, which are controlled by crypto-currency and security trading algorithms that us
humans can’t even understand. What we do understand, is that they are so efcient, it’s a guaranteed
system to make profts from N starting capital.</p>

<p>The result is what we call Universal Basic Income. The ROBOTS took all our day jobs, so what we are left
with, is simply the choice of WHAT to invest our savings in. We simply buy a tiny $200 appliance called
“M.I.A.” on Amazon, send it Bitcoins periodically, and we get back way more Bitcoins than we put in.
And because of her, we do a lot of partying and slacking of. <strong>Cheers!</strong></p>

<h2 id="ready-to-get-plug--paid">Ready to get Plug-&amp;-PAID?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Buy a 4”x2” IOT micro-appliance, known as “M.I.A.” from GetMIA.io, for $275 fully assembled.</li>
  <li>Power it with a USB cable (or battery pack) and connect via Wi-Fi or Ethernet cable.</li>
  <li>MIA creates a locally-hosted Bitcoin wallet, and a BTC address (or choose your crypto-currency) for you
send coins to, displays the QR code on her 3.5” touch screen. Control it with a built-in
webserver/GUI, or SSH/VNC for nerds.</li>
  <li>Send her capital, and she invests using a strategy you can choose from some presets. These
presets are the statistically most proftable algorithms on the ZalgoNet “SWARM” p2p network,
sorted by projected risk, based on empirical, anonymized telemetry results. Through SWARM, she
works with and benefts from other M.I.A.’s anonymously, creating a hive-mind mesh network.</li>
  <li>M.I.A. invests your BTC with artifcially-intelligent day trading algorithms and “smart” hedgefunding,
communicating directly with exchanges using API keys you’ve entered into the GUI.</li>
  <li>Any profts are sent to you as daily payments to a BTC address of your choosing.</li>
  <li>Go party!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="meshed-online-learning-for-the-everyman">Meshed online learning for the Everyman.</h2>

<p>Online Machine-Learning will liberate mankind one day. The problem is that currently, it’s just TOO DAMN
HARD for the Everyman to set up or even understand. Thus, as of yet, those who beneft from Machine
Learning are the Big Corps and Govt’s. M.I.A. Changes this by making it trivial to use the vast powers of
Intelligent ROBOTS for immediate gain, thus granting fnancial stability to all.</p>

<h2 id="beneficial-side-effect-a-massive-increase-in-market-participation-and-liquidity">Beneficial Side-effect: A massive increase in market participation, and liquidity.</h2>

<p>With the Average Joe in 3rd world countries investing his wages in global markets, get ready for a huge
tidal wave of liquidity. Suddenly, struggling markets will spring to new life. And this is just the beginning.</p>

<p>Thanks, M.I.A.!</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
  <p>According to Drake Equation estimates, the closest aliens in our own galaxy are likely to be about 21,000 light-years away. That means it will take 21 thousand years for our signals to reach them, and 21 thousand years to wait for a response. By the time we get a response, they may be all dead, or we may be all dead. That is some serious PING time!</p>

<p>Aliens may very well exist, in fact their existence may be a probabilistic certainty. But in all likelihood, one civilization won’t know about the other(s) unless it has existed for over 42 thousand years, and the foreign one has existed for at least 21 thousand years.</p>

<p>That is all assuming that both civilizations are actively trying to contact each other, and listen for any possible transmissions, and can decipher such transmissions meaningfully and concoct and transmit a logical response.</p>

<p>Assuming a civilization broadcasts messages for an average of 10,000 years, there may be about 22 currently broadcasting civilizations in our galaxy. Assuming 500 years (which may be much more realistic, since we’ve only been broadcasting for less than 100 years), there may be just 1.2 civilizations – Ours.</p>

[8:02 PM] carlos8f: ha. i like when people ask me that
[8:02 PM] LoneWolf345: Or is it a hex number?
[8:02 PM] carlos8f: just a minute
[8:02 PM] carlos8f: i used to explain it on my website
[8:02 PM] carlos8f: but the website's been down for a while
[8:15 PM] carlos8f: @LoneWolf345 ok, here you go :smile: https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/916687a81a6232981af601f362a7640e

S8F.md

[8:17 PM] LoneWolf345: Fun
[8:17 PM] carlos8f: yep, I have no idea who sent me that email
[8:18 PM] carlos8f: it's the greatest mystery of my life
[8:18 PM] carlos8f: like, what were they even trying to do?
[8:19 PM] carlos8f: quote jonathan livingston seagull and cross it with something about cannisters?
[8:19 PM] carlos8f: LOL
[8:19 PM] carlos8f: and why S8F as the subject
[8:19 PM] carlos8f: i will never know.
[8:19 PM] LoneWolf345: My profile pic say “stupid as a rat”.  It was something an old roommate called once when he was mad.  Never heard of that before so I decided to embrace it.  Paid to have a logo made, started a website for all my experimental stuff, all that fun.
[8:20 PM] LoneWolf345: That was so many years ago but it still my gravatar
[8:20 PM] Crankshaw: lol email.  they were probably just seeing what emails existed out there. checking for bounces (or the lack of)
[8:20 PM] carlos8f: lol, sounds like a cynical motto
[8:21 PM] carlos8f: i can understand checking for bounces, but why did they have to get CREATIVE lol
[8:21 PM] carlos8f: it makes no sense
[8:21 PM] Crankshaw: yeah lol
[8:21 PM] carlos8f: some genius hacker probably that has autism and can't formulate sentences
[8:22 PM] Crankshaw: maybe they ran some books through a markov chain thing and used it instead of lorem ipsum
[8:22 PM] Crankshaw: might have been to avoid spam filters
[8:22 PM] Crankshaw: but uhh, not sure why they would need to
[8:22 PM] carlos8f: yeah, but there was no URL in the email!
[8:22 PM] carlos8f: WTF! what are they baiting me with!
[8:22 PM] Crankshaw: yeah, it's all rather odd
[8:22 PM] carlos8f: this is a new category of spam entirely
[8:22 PM] carlos8f: it's the kind of spam that is more like performance art
[8:22 PM] Crankshaw: seemingly for no reason at all
[8:23 PM] Crankshaw: maybe s8f was a sequence id
[8:23 PM] Crankshaw: and you need to find all the others
[8:23 PM] Crankshaw: and put them together
[8:23 PM] Crankshaw: and only then will the world see what the real message is
[8:23 PM] carlos8f: maybe, a hacker wrote a script that sends those random fucked up emails from EVERY server he conquers in his botnet...
[8:23 PM] Crankshaw: ohhh, interesting theory.  could be a form of stenography
[8:24 PM] Crankshaw: one of the mass emails will be to a specific address and contain a specific random phrase
[8:24 PM] carlos8f: the trippy part, was when i was re-reading  jonathan livingston seagull randomly, and I found the passage that matched the email i was so puzzled about! i was like, MIND BLOWN
[8:24 PM] Crankshaw: haha
[8:25 PM] carlos8f: it was like real-world da-vinci code
[8:25 PM] carlos8f: they picked a really obscure book, and i happened to read it AFTER I got the email
[8:25 PM] carlos8f: and happened to recognize the passage
[8:25 PM] carlos8f: even though it was garbled in the email
[8:26 PM] brucetus: haha that email
[8:26 PM] carlos8f: it's from russia or something
[8:26 PM] Crankshaw: so many different email addresses in the headers lol
[8:26 PM] carlos8f: i'm pretty sure it was the mischief of some genius russian hacker :stuck_out_tongue:
[8:27 PM] carlos8f: who was attacking and blacklisting all his kills to death for the fun of it
[8:27 PM] Crankshaw: I need to google "The Bat!" now
[8:27 PM] carlos8f: yeah, that is one of the funniest details of the whle thing
[8:27 PM] carlos8f: what is "the bat"? LOL
[8:28 PM] Crankshaw: oh it's just an email client as it turns out
[8:28 PM] Crankshaw: like eudora

The Bat! is a secure desktop email client for Windows, designed to protect your correspondence against third-parties and to save your time.
[8:30 PM] carlos8f: oh geez, this is totally a crypto hacker
[8:30 PM] carlos8f: he's using end to end!!!
[8:30 PM] carlos8f: almost no one uses that with email
[8:31 PM] carlos8f: certainly not in 2006
[8:31 PM] carlos8f: ferdinand brandon is some kind of alias
[8:31 PM] carlos8f: i wish i could meet that guy
[8:32 PM] carlos8f: ok, so if it's just a regular email client, why was he targeting a whole list of addresses?
[8:32 PM] carlos8f: wouldn't a spammer use custom software to send the emails?
[8:32 PM] Crankshaw: yeah it's all rather odd.  possibly just a spoofed header though
[8:32 PM] Crankshaw: or an infected pc that used an installed "The Bat!"
[8:33 PM] carlos8f: why choose the  Bat as the spoofed client
[8:33 PM] Crankshaw: could've just called the "send an email" thing and that was the registered app for it
[8:33 PM] carlos8f: possibly
[8:33 PM] Crankshaw: ahh, fuck knows lol.
[8:33 PM] Crankshaw: it's all so strange
[8:33 PM] carlos8f: but, then they would get their IP blacklisted immediately
[8:33 PM] carlos8f: the logic totally eludes me
[8:34 PM] Crankshaw: yeah, wtf
[8:35 PM] carlos8f: anyway, that's what carlos8f comes from :smiley:
[8:35 PM] carlos8f: now you know the lore
[8:36 PM] carlos8f: coming up on the 12 year anniversary
[8:36 PM] carlos8f: i should re-launch s8f.org
[8:55 PM] LoneWolf345: Nice

<h1 id="what-does-s8f-mean">What does “S8F” mean?</h1>

<p>The name “S8F” came to me, oddly, through <a href="https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/3491314">an unsolicited email from one “Ferdinand Brandon”</a> I received on Tuesday, July 11th 2006.</p>

<p>The subject, simply “S8F”, didn’t make sense, and neither did the message itself, which was simply nonsense!</p>

<p>Not the kind of spam you get every day!</p>

<p>The more I read the message, I began to recognize something familiar. There were pieces of a book I’d read, Jonathan Livingston Seagull. The other bits were apparently from another work of fiction. Inspired by a spam message that had failed utterly at its job (to sell me something), I made a portmanteau out of my name, carloS8F.</p>

<p>I have come to pronounce S8F as “safe”, and have used the domain s8f.org for all things experimental.</p>

<p>I usually pronounce “carlos8f” as “Carlos ehh-t eff” but since I prounce S8F as “safe”, I should probably be saying “Carlo-seyf”.</p>
