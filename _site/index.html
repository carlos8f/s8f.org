[8:02 PM] carlos8f: ha. i like when people ask me that
[8:02 PM] LoneWolf345: Or is it a hex number?
[8:02 PM] carlos8f: just a minute
[8:02 PM] carlos8f: i used to explain it on my website
[8:02 PM] carlos8f: but the website's been down for a while
[8:15 PM] carlos8f: @LoneWolf345 ok, here you go :smile: https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/916687a81a6232981af601f362a7640e

S8F.md
S8F.md

[8:17 PM] LoneWolf345: Fun
[8:17 PM] carlos8f: yep, I have no idea who sent me that email
[8:18 PM] carlos8f: it's the greatest mystery of my life
[8:18 PM] carlos8f: like, what were they even trying to do?
[8:19 PM] carlos8f: quote jonathan livingston seagull and cross it with something about cannisters?
[8:19 PM] carlos8f: LOL
[8:19 PM] carlos8f: and why S8F as the subject
[8:19 PM] carlos8f: i will never know.
[8:19 PM] LoneWolf345: My profile pic say ‚Äústupid as a rat‚Äù.  It was something an old roommate called once when he was mad.  Never heard of that before so I decided to embrace it.  Paid to have a logo made, started a website for all my experimental stuff, all that fun.
[8:20 PM] LoneWolf345: That was so many years ago but it still my gravatar
[8:20 PM] Crankshaw: lol email.  they were probably just seeing what emails existed out there. checking for bounces (or the lack of)
[8:20 PM] carlos8f: lol, sounds like a cynical motto
[8:21 PM] carlos8f: i can understand checking for bounces, but why did they have to get CREATIVE lol
[8:21 PM] carlos8f: it makes no sense
[8:21 PM] Crankshaw: yeah lol
[8:21 PM] carlos8f: some genius hacker probably that has autism and can't formulate sentences
[8:22 PM] Crankshaw: maybe they ran some books through a markov chain thing and used it instead of lorem ipsum
[8:22 PM] Crankshaw: might have been to avoid spam filters
[8:22 PM] Crankshaw: but uhh, not sure why they would need to
[8:22 PM] carlos8f: yeah, but there was no URL in the email!
[8:22 PM] carlos8f: WTF! what are they baiting me with!
[8:22 PM] Crankshaw: yeah, it's all rather odd
[8:22 PM] carlos8f: this is a new category of spam entirely
[8:22 PM] carlos8f: it's the kind of spam that is more like performance art
[8:22 PM] Crankshaw: seemingly for no reason at all
[8:23 PM] Crankshaw: maybe s8f was a sequence id
[8:23 PM] Crankshaw: and you need to find all the others
[8:23 PM] Crankshaw: and put them together
[8:23 PM] Crankshaw: and only then will the world see what the real message is
[8:23 PM] carlos8f: maybe, a hacker wrote a script that sends those random fucked up emails from EVERY server he conquers in his botnet...
[8:23 PM] Crankshaw: ohhh, interesting theory.  could be a form of stenography
[8:24 PM] Crankshaw: one of the mass emails will be to a specific address and contain a specific random phrase
[8:24 PM] carlos8f: the trippy part, was when i was re-reading  jonathan livingston seagull randomly, and I found the passage that matched the email i was so puzzled about! i was like, MIND BLOWN
[8:24 PM] Crankshaw: haha
[8:25 PM] carlos8f: it was like real-world da-vinci code
[8:25 PM] carlos8f: they picked a really obscure book, and i happened to read it AFTER I got the email
[8:25 PM] carlos8f: and happened to recognize the passage
[8:25 PM] carlos8f: even though it was garbled in the email
[8:26 PM] brucetus: haha that email
[8:26 PM] carlos8f: it's from russia or something
[8:26 PM] Crankshaw: so many different email addresses in the headers lol
[8:26 PM] carlos8f: i'm pretty sure it was the mischief of some genius russian hacker :stuck_out_tongue:
[8:27 PM] carlos8f: who was attacking and blacklisting all his kills to death for the fun of it
[8:27 PM] Crankshaw: I need to google "The Bat!" now
[8:27 PM] carlos8f: yeah, that is one of the funniest details of the whle thing
[8:27 PM] carlos8f: what is "the bat"? LOL
[8:28 PM] Crankshaw: oh it's just an email client as it turns out
[8:28 PM] Crankshaw: like eudora
[8:28 PM] Crankshaw: https://www.ritlabs.com/en/products/thebat/
The Bat! - Secure Desktop Email Client for Windows 10
The Bat! is a secure desktop email client for Windows, designed to protect your correspondence against third-parties and to save your time.
[8:30 PM] carlos8f: oh geez, this is totally a crypto hacker
[8:30 PM] carlos8f: he's using end to end!!!
[8:30 PM] carlos8f: almost no one uses that with email
[8:31 PM] carlos8f: certainly not in 2006
[8:31 PM] carlos8f: ferdinand brandon is some kind of alias
[8:31 PM] carlos8f: i wish i could meet that guy
[8:32 PM] carlos8f: ok, so if it's just a regular email client, why was he targeting a whole list of addresses?
[8:32 PM] carlos8f: wouldn't a spammer use custom software to send the emails?
[8:32 PM] Crankshaw: yeah it's all rather odd.  possibly just a spoofed header though
[8:32 PM] Crankshaw: or an infected pc that used an installed "The Bat!"
[8:33 PM] carlos8f: why choose the  Bat as the spoofed client
[8:33 PM] Crankshaw: could've just called the "send an email" thing and that was the registered app for it
[8:33 PM] carlos8f: possibly
[8:33 PM] Crankshaw: ahh, fuck knows lol.
[8:33 PM] Crankshaw: it's all so strange
[8:33 PM] carlos8f: but, then they would get their IP blacklisted immediately
[8:33 PM] carlos8f: the logic totally eludes me
[8:34 PM] Crankshaw: yeah, wtf
[8:35 PM] carlos8f: anyway, that's what carlos8f comes from :smiley:
[8:35 PM] carlos8f: now you know the lore
[8:36 PM] carlos8f: coming up on the 12 year anniversary
[8:36 PM] carlos8f: i should re-launch s8f.org
[8:55 PM] LoneWolf345: Nice
[8:55 PM] LoneWolf345: Glad I asked

<h1 id="what-does-s8f-mean">What does ‚ÄúS8F‚Äù mean?</h1>

<p>The name ‚ÄúS8F‚Äù came to me, oddly, through <a href="https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/3491314">an unsolicited email from one ‚ÄúFerdinand Brandon‚Äù</a> I received on Tuesday, July 11th 2006.</p>

<p>The subject, simply ‚ÄúS8F‚Äù, didn‚Äôt make sense, and neither did the message itself, which was simply nonsense!</p>

<p>Not the kind of spam you get every day!</p>

<p>The more I read the message, I began to recognize something familiar. There were pieces of a book I‚Äôd read, Jonathan Livingston Seagull. The other bits were apparently from another work of fiction. Inspired by a spam message that had failed utterly at its job (to sell me something), I made a portmanteau out of my name, carloS8F.</p>

<p>I have come to pronounce S8F as ‚Äúsafe‚Äù, and have used the domain s8f.org for all things experimental.</p>

<p>I usually pronounce ‚Äúcarlos8f‚Äù as ‚ÄúCarlos ehh-t eff‚Äù but since I prounce S8F as ‚Äúsafe‚Äù, I should probably be saying ‚ÄúCarlo-seyf‚Äù.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
  <p>Today, I accidentally came up with an alternative, novel solution to the classic interview question, ‚ÄúThe 3 Light Switches‚Äù.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/9fd4053e4af2d12c2d070c2c42c2e6d4">Proof of discovery and originality</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/puzzles/comments/51zoi8/my_solution_to_the_3_lightbulb_switches_problem_%E8%B7%AF/">Post on /r/puzzles</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose that you are standing in a hallway next to 3 light switches, which are all off. There is another room down the hallway, where there are 3 incandescent light bulbs ‚Äì each light bulb is operated by one of the switches in the hallway. Because the light bulbs are in another room, you can not see them since you are standing in the hallway.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you figure out which switch operates which light bulb, if you can only go the room with the light bulbs one time, and only one time?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-official-solution">The ‚ÄúOfficial‚Äù Solution</h3>

<ul>
  <li>turn on switch A.</li>
  <li>turn on switch B briefly, and turn it off.</li>
  <li>go in the room</li>
  <li>notice the lit bulb, that‚Äôs switch A.</li>
  <li>notice the ‚Äúwarm‚Äù bulb, with your hand. that‚Äôs switch B.</li>
  <li>the final bulb is switch C.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="my-alternative-solution">My Alternative Solution</h3>

<ul>
  <li>label the switches A, B and C</li>
  <li>turn switch A on</li>
  <li>open door</li>
  <li>go into room</li>
  <li>notice the lit bulb. that‚Äôs switch A. unscrew it and carry it with you, labeling it A.</li>
  <li>the room goes dark.</li>
  <li>unscrew one of the other bulbs, label it X, and carry it with you.</li>
  <li>do NOT touch the door on the way out, leaving it open</li>
  <li>exit the room.</li>
  <li>turn on switch B. does light appear in the room?</li>
  <li>if yes, the bulb in the room is switch B.</li>
  <li>if no, the bulb in the room is switch C.</li>
  <li>the ‚ÄúX‚Äù bulb is the remaining switch, either B or C depending on the light or darkness coming from the room.</li>
