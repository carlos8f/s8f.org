<h3>What is s8f.org?</h3>

<p>This is the personal website of me, <a href="https://keybase.io/carlos8f">Carlos Rodriguez &quot;carlos8f&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>My name is Carlos Rodriguez and I&#8217;m a 30-something hacker/musician living in Watsonville, California.</p>

<p>I enjoy coffee, reading, hacking on the $bash console, playing music and making lame jokes. Sports I like are disc golf, hockey (go Sharks!), MMA, racquetball and people-watching.</p>

<p>I was a co-founder of Terra Eclipse, Inc., and now I run my own business, <a href="https://bot18.net/">ZalgoNet</a> (software for high-frequency trading of crypto-currencies). I am not for hire.</p>

<p><img src='/files/reactor-logo.jpg' alt='s8f.org logo' /></p>

<p>The name for this site (and my nickname) come from <a href="https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/916687a81a6232981af601f362a7640e" target="_blank">a brilliant piece of spam I once received</a> entitled &#8220;S8F&#8221;. Aside from being complete genius (finally a piece of spam that wasn&#8217;t trying to sell me something), it also included bits of <em>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</em>, a book I&#8217;m quite fond of. References to the &#8216;canisters&#8217; seems to echo into eternity. I chose the faded logo image of s8f.org from a 60&#8217;s era pamphlet put out by the U.S. government, depicting a scientist servicing parts of a nuclear reactor. This is my interpretation of &#8220;I stepped inside and went straight for the canisters.&#8221;</p>
