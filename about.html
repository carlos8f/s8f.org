<h3>What is s8f.org?</h3>

<p>This is the personal website of me, <a href="https://keybase.io/carlos8f">Carlos Rodriguez &quot;carlos8f&quot;</a>.</p>

<h3>What does it mean?</h3>

<p>The name &ldquo;S8F&rdquo; came to me, oddly, through an
<a href="https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/3491314">unsolicited email</a> from one
"Ferdinand Brandon". The subject, simply &ldquo;S8F&rdquo;, didn't make sense,
and neither did the message itself, which was simply nonsense. Not the kind of
spam you get every day!</p>

<p>The more I read the message, I began to recognize something familiar. There
were pieces of a book I'd read,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Livingston_Seagull"><i>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</i></a>.
The other bits were apparently from another work of fiction. Inspired by
a spam message that had failed utterly at its job (to sell me something), I
made a portmanteau out of my name, <i>carloS8F</i>.</p>

<p>I have come to pronounce S8F as &ldquo;safe&rdquo;, and have used the domain
s8f.org for all things experimental.</p>
