title:  "Zenbot 3.0.3 released!"
---

Announcing [Zenbot 3.0.3](https://github.com/carlos8f/zenbot), my cryptocurrency trading bot. Over a month in development, this release has loads of improvements, including:

- a universal plugin system to build new functionality (inculding exchanges, mappers, reducers, reporters, indicators, and so on)
- built on a new super-efficient parallel processing engine, [Zenbrain](https://github.com/carlos8f/zenbrain)
- generic exchange/currency pair support, to support multiple exchanges or currencies in the same Zenbot installation
- realtime technical analysis, including [RSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_strength_index) computation
- realtime candlestick graph using [TechanJS](http://techanjs.org/), hosted on a built-in HTTP server
- historical data mining and ROI analysis using your trade logic, with virtual trades plotted on real price graphs

## Quick-start

### 1. Requirements: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center)

### 2. Install zenbot 3:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/carlos8f/zenbot.git
cd zenbot
npm install
```

### 3. Edit `config.js` with API keys, database credentials, trade logic, etc.

### 4. Run zenbot on the exchange:

```shell
./run.sh
```

### 5. Open the live graph URL provided in the console.

To access the CLI,

```shell
zenbot

  Usage: zenbot [options] [command]

  Commands:

    server [options]            launch the server
    launch [options] [cmds...]  launch multiple commands
    map [options]               map
    reduce [options]            reduce
    run                         run
    sim [options]               sim

  Options:

    -h, --help     output usage information
    -V, --version  output the version number
```

The `./run.sh` script combines `launch map --backfill reduce run server`, so use the CLI to access the other commands.

### 6. Simulation

Once backfill has finished, run a simulation:

```shell
zenbot sim
```

Zenbot will return you a list of virtual trades, and an ROI figure. Open the URL provided in the console (while running the server) to see the virtual trades plotted on a candlestick graph. Tweak `config.js` for new trade strategies and check your results this way.

### 7. Web console

When the server is running, and you have visited the `?secret` URL provided in the console, you can access an aggregated, live feed of log messages at `http://localhost:3013/logs`. Example:

## About the default trade logic in config.js

- uses [GDAX](https://gdax.com/) API
- watches/trades BTC/USD
- acts at 15m increments (ticks)
- computes 14-period 15m RSI
- considers `RSI > 70` overbought and `RSI < 30` oversold
- trades 95% of current balance, market price

You can tweak `config.js` from there to use bitfinex, or trade ETH, or whatever. Common `config.js` logic will be moved to core or plugins in later versions of zenbot. Use `zenbot sim` to check your trade strategy against historical trades.

Auto-learn support and more exchange support will come soon. Will accept PR's :) With the 3.x plugin architecture, external plugins are possible too (published as their own repo/module).

Enjoy and please contribute/support to Zenbot and get the word out!
