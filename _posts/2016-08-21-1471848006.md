## Zenbot [**3.4.0**](https://github.com/carlos8f/zenbot/releases/tag/v3.4.0) (Latest)

- Re-organized the config so `config.js` is git-ignored, so you should copy `config_sample.js` to `config.js`. `config_defaults.js` provides all options that you can override in `config.js`.
- Many config variable changes, such as `c.watch_exchanges` instead of `c.enabled_plugins`, see `config_sample.js` for details.
- Zenbrain updated.
- Development now happening in `develop` branch, master will be pushed to only on stable releases going forward.
