a.k.a. "the impossibly awesome web development framework"

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/carlos8f/motley.png)](http://travis-ci.org/carlos8f/motley)

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/motley.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/motley/)

## Introduction

Cyberpunking the internets. That's what you should be doing right now, and
Motley is the <del>fool</del> tool for you, heh heh. It combines the best:

- [LevelDB schemaless models](https://www.npmjs.org/package/modeler-leveldb)
- [Handlebars views](https://www.npmjs.org/package/templ)
- [express-compatible](https://github.com/cpsubrian/node-expres)
  [middleware and controllers](https://www.npmjs.org/package/middler)
- [dynamicly](https://www.npmjs.org/package/saw) [fast file server](https://www.npmjs.org/package/buffet)
- [intelligent gzip compression and e-tag support](https://www.npmjs.org/package/dish)
- [LevelDB-backed session persistence and authentication](https://github.com/carlos8f/sess)
- and [auto-loadable application structure](https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/cd931ba95481a7570602)

...with impossibly awesome gist integration, allowing you to do
lightning-fast prototyping or complete application development, all with
just two shell commands.

## Installation

`$ npm install -g motley`

## Famous two-line bootstrap

```
$ motley-init my-project 
$ motley my-project
server running at http://localhost:3000/
```

## One-line gist creation

```
$ motley-init --gist [--public] [--open] [my-project]
```

This will:

- prompt you for your github credentials, which are then exchanged
  for an [access token](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gist-cli) and cached at
  `~/.gist-login`
- create a gist containing a new motley project
- check out the gist's git repo via ssh
- open your browser and point it to the gist

Then you have a brand new fully functioning web app, runnable with the `motley` binary,
tied to a new git repo, backed by [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/), and
all you had to do was type `motley-init`!
