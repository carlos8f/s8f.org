title:  "Why I ditched Comodo SSL (and you should, too)"

The trust we put in [Certificate Authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) is highly underestimated in today's online world. This is because TLS on the modern web is based on a **broken model of trust.** There is [no trust agility](https://moxie.org/blog/ssl-and-the-future-of-authenticity/), and this spells doom for everyone. In this article I'll try to explain how and why.

### But why not trust SSL? It says <span style="color:green">green lock <i class="fa fa-fw fa-lock"></i></span> in my browser so it's secure, right?

Not really.

### Amazon uses it, and so do all the big companies. So it's secure.

Still no. Let's take Amazon as an example:

![amazon cert issed by Symantec](/files/amazon_cert.png)

1. You trust Amazon.com with your credit card to buy socks. Because you **need** socks.
2. Maybe you did your homework and looked at Amazon.com's address bar, which showed a <span style="color:green">green lock <i class="fa fa-fw fa-lock"></i></span> and that looks nice and secure, so "I know I can trust that **no man-in-the-middle got my credit card #**"
3. If you looked a little deeper, you'd see that Amazon's cert is issued by **[Symantec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symantec)**. They do antivirus software, so that should be **fine**, right?
4. Except certs can change at any time. Tomorrow, Amazon might start using one issued by [Comodo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comodo_Group), because they're **cheaper**. Win for everyone?
5. The next day you get a call from your bank, saying your credit card was **cancelled** and a new one was issued in the mail. They cited "suspicious activity" as the cause. **What the heck**?
6. Then you read in the news that **some hacker** issued some rogue certs for Amazon.com. **Big deal right?**
7. The hacker set up some **DNS spoofing** that pointed your Coffee Shop internet connection to **193.293.20.10** (evil server), presenting a "valid" SSL cert, actually issued by **Comodo**. Comodo is trusted by browsers, so your browser didn't even notice that it's talking to **evil server** and not directly to Amazon.
8. They proxied your requests to the real Amazon.com, so YOU didn't even notice, and for fun they also **extracted your CC number**, Amazon password, email address, and mail address to their **evil server**.
9. SSL didn't protect you, it only **misled you** into (ultimately) trusting a compromised trust chain.

### But what if Comodo is now hack-proof and they revoked the bad certs and they're fully trustable again?

Sure. But their root CA cert is still **trusted by default** in major browsers. That means **ANY certs** they create will be trusted by everyone.

### Why is that a problem? I trust Comodo...

What if they wanted to **MITM your Amazon.com session** for their own purposes? Easy:

1. Comodo creates their **OWN certs** for <span style="color:green">Amazon.com <i class="fa fa-fw fa-lock"></i></span>, Comodo owning the private key.
2. Comodo sets up **evil proxies** that use that cert and forward to the real Amazon.com
3. Comodo now **owns** your "encrypted" SSL traffic to Amazon.com

### I don't believe Comodo would be that evil.

Well, for a start:

- They [bundled malware into their downloads](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2887632/secure-advertising-tool-privdog-compromises-https-security.html) called PrivDog, claiming to protect users, but actually enabling a MITM attack.
- They [disabled same-origin security](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=704) in their custom browser, effectively enabling arbitrary MITM attacks.
- They [continued issuing certs used in malware](http://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/comodo-continue-to-to-issue-certificates-to-known-malware-343022/).
- They declared [trademark war on Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/2016/06/23/defending-our-brand.html) for "stealing" the idea of the "90-day free SSL".
- Their CEO is a [bit of a douche](https://twitter.com/feross/status/746102800531128320).

For background, Comodo has a **monopoly** on SSL certs:

![ca market share](/files/ca_market_share.png)

### But why would a company with a 40% market share do this?

Comodo sees [Lets Encrypt as threat](https://forums.comodo.com/general-discussion-off-topic-anything-and-everything/shame-on-you-comodo-t115958.0.html;msg837411#msg837411) to their monopoly on "90-day free SSL". Comodo is not free though, it costs roughly **$20-90** for a low-level cert. Let's Encrypt is **free forever**.

### Why would Lets Encrypt want to offer something for free? I want to pay money in exchange for trust, like I do in other industries.

That's where they got you. SSL **should** be free, because privacy should be a right, and SSL is critical for privacy. Further, introducing a middle-man (Comodo in this case) compromises your privacy, as shown above. Comodo doesn't even **verify that you own the domain**, instead it requires you to respond to an email sent to `webmaster@yourdomain.com` or similar. It takes roughly 20 mins to set up.

By contrast, Lets Encrypt does [real domain validation](https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/) using a [new, open protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-02) called ACME. Since the whole process can be automated, human intervention (and thus the CA industry) is **rendered redundant**.

### Well, as long as I don't buy a Comodo cert I'm fine, right?

Not exactly. If 40% of the web uses Comodo, that makes **40% of the web compromisable by the same hacker**, by hacking a single crypto (root CA) keypair. That is super dangerous for the entire internet. In truth, Comodo has [already been hacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comodo_Group#Certificate_hacking), and will probably be hacked again.

### OK I give up. I'll just use CloudFlare to secure and accelerate my site.

[CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) specializes in **security** and performance. Thus, they offer a service that ["protects and accellerates"](https://www.cloudflare.com/overview/) your website. Oh, and they also register a Comodo cert and use it for your domain:

![cloudflare cert](/files/cloudflare_cert.png)

### Wait, doesn't that mean they are MITM-ing my site's visitors?

Yes! It does. Both **CloudFlare** (who owns the cert private keys) and **Comodo** (who can issue any cert) are trusted by all browsers. But why is the trust there? Because of the **CA industry**, and its influence on browser makers.

### I still trust WellsFargo.com to do my online banking, and they use a Symantec cert.

What if Wells Fargo hired a new web developer 

### Can't we remove Comodo from the list of trusted CA's?

Maybe, but so many sites were lured into using Comodo because of **low prices**, that 40% of the web would break if Firefox and Google started blacklisting their certs. And of course, we know that **web users hate it** when stuff breaks, so web companies (and the web at large) generally won't risk breaking changes. That spells doom for the [Cryptographic Agility](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2016/05/16/agility.html) of the web.

### Oh great. What now?

- Use <span style="color:green">Let's Encrypt <i class="fa fa-fw fa-lock"></i></span> (or [DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/), if you have the money). It's free and only takes 10 minutes to switch.
- The catch is that `certbot` **could** middle-man your server.
- We need to make sure Let's Encrypt stays **open**, free, and peer-reviewed. Eventually, perhaps SSL certs will be issued for a small fee by the government(s), for **public privacy and security**.
- Then, and only then, can we stop the Comodo monopoly future **trust breakdown apocalypse**.

### Conclusion

As of today, I'm proud to say I'm **no longer** a Comodo customer, and [s8f.org](https://s8f.org/) now runs on a <span style="color:green">Let's Encrypt <i class="fa fa-fw fa-lock"></i></span> cert.
