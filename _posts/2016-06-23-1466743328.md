40 years ago today, Diffie and Hellman invented the public key exchange algorithm. Today, I present you:

### [Salty 4.0](https://github.com/carlos8f/salty/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

- now you can regenerate your decryption key with `salty init --regen`
- switch to base58-encoding for everything but hashes
- hashes are now hex-encoded
- `\r\n` newlines in header/PEM changed to `\n`
- Custom header support for encryption or signing
- import now dedupes on verifyPk/email
- key removal by pubkey/email now supported
- "attached" signatures now available with ASCII armor flag
- signatures can be verified without previous setup (wallet creation)
- signatures support arbitrary hash algorithms
- added `--no-translate` flag to output raw header
