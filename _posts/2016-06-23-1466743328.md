title:  "Salty 4.0 released"
---

40 years ago today, Diffie and Hellman invented the public key exchange algorithm. Today, I present you:

## Salty

Salty is a [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)-powered CLI-based alternative to PGP/GPG using [NaCl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaCl_(software)) instead of RSA/DSA.

Github repo here: https://github.com/carlos8f/salty

Commits and tags in this repo are signed with GPG key [5FBB 2F98 3862 1AFF](https://keybase.io/carlos8f).

### Upcoming GUI

A GUI is being developed as a node HTTP server you can host locally or remotely to access your wallet. Follow its development [here](https://github.com/carlos8f/salty-gui).

### Features

- NO [3rd parties](https://peerio.com/pricing.html), NO [p2p network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)), NO [browser js](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2011/august/javascript-cryptography-considered-harmful/), NO [exotic/compiled deps](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html), no [Comodo SSL](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/4pj89t/support_lets_encrypt_get_cloudflare_cdn_et_al_to/), and NO [shady corporations](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity). PERIOD.
- general purpose CLI, lightweight library attached
- audited, bundled dependencies - no install scripts or backdoors
- supports anonymous-sender or signed/verified messaging
- sharable pubkey string that can fit in a single tweet
- does NOT use your ssh keys, pgp keys, or anything RSA
- encrypt public key is always ephemeral - does NOT leak metadata
- sender identity is deniable, unless they explicitly commit to sign the message
- file length hidden with padding
- public signing/verifying with detached signatures
- binary or "ascii armor" PEM output
- import/export your wallet folder - PEM encoded and secretboxed with Scrypt KDF
- (new in 3.1) can use anonymous private [Github gists](https://gist.github.com/) to remotely store salty messages
- (new in 3.1) full tar/gz support for encrypting/decrypting directories (supports symmetric or asymmetric cipher)
- MIT-licensed

## Install (Mac OSX)

```
$ brew tap carlos8f/tap
$ brew install salty
```

## Other UNIX-based platforms:

Install first: [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)

```
$ wget https://github.com/carlos8f/salty/archive/v4.1.0.tar.gz
$ shasum -a 256 v4.1.0.tar.gz
3eb6e0bcb1461af2aa88d81c9be5c69b1b0069e40a30abb90c11420c88504126  v4.1.0.tar.gz

## Patch notes (4.1.1)

- no longer asks for name/email for wallet
- fix translateHeader if no name/email
- fix ascii armor signature headers not wrapped
- add signing examples
- updated generic install example to use wget instead of git
- now you can regenerate your decryption key with `salty init --regen`
- switch to base58-encoding for everything but hashes
- hashes are now hex-encoded
- `\r\n` newlines in header/PEM changed to `\n`
- Custom header support for encryption or signing
- import now dedupes on verifyPk/email
- key removal by pubkey/email now supported
- "attached" signatures now available with ASCII armor flag
- signatures can be verified without previous setup (wallet creation)
- signatures support arbitrary hash algorithms
- added `--no-translate` flag to output raw header
