# Timeline

```
<<<< stepping in, and going straight for the canisters... >>>>
```

- 1969 - C language developed by Dennis Ritchie for Bell Labs. US Dept. of Defense develops ARPANET (later the Internet). Man lands on the moon.
- Jan 1st, 1970 - UNIX epoch begins.
- 1977 - RSA encryption algorithm invented.
- 1982 - RSA developers found RSA Data Security as a private company to promote their then-proprietary encryption techniques.
- Jan. 24th, 1991 - Then-[Sen. Joe Biden](https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/senate-bill/266) authors the "Comprehensive Counter-Terrorism Act of 1991", advocating for mandated government-planted backdoors in all encrypted consumer devices.
- 1991 - Philip Zimmermann releases the [first version of PGP](https://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/essays/WhyIWrotePGP.html) in response to S.266.
- [1991 - 1994] - The age of Floppy Disks, AOL, 14.4k modems, and The Fresh Prince of Bell Air.
- 1997 - Adam L. Young and Moti Yung present a "cryptovirology" paper on building backdoors into asymmetric algorithms.
- 1999 - German government funds [GnuPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard), a free re-implementation of PGP.
- early 2000's - NSA starts pushing ["Dual_EC_DRBG"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG) as the standard for secure random number generation. This marks the start of NSA's "Bullrun" crypto surveillance program.
- 2006 - RSA Security, Inc. acquired by EMC Corporation for $2.1 billion.
- 2007 - The potential for a backdoor in Dual_EC_DRBG is documented by Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson.
- early 2008 - Biden becomes vice-president.
- May 2008 - "Satoshi Nakamoto", whose real identity is still a mystery, published the first Bitcoin paper. Notable was its idiosyncratic insistence on using Elliptic Curve cryptography which had not been officially standardized to secure real human assets. Whoever Nakamoto is, holds one of the largest hoards of Bitcoins (presently worth about $443 each) in existence.
- January 19, 2012 - Secure hosting service [Mega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_(service)) (based in New Zealand) shut down by the US Dept. of Justice.
- October 16, 2012 - Zimmermann involved in founding Silent Circle, a secure e-email service based in Switzerland, operating under a subscription business model.
- January 2013 - A user named anon108 posted a 12-minute video guide "GPG for Journalists" to Vimeo using voice modulation. The Washington Post later identified anon108 as fugitive NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.
- April 11th, 2013 - [secushare.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20130421103548/http://secushare.org/) launches, a niche p2p file sharing network, proclaiming "PGP encrypts end to end, but does not provide PFS - in fact it tends to be a forever proof of your deeds online."
- May 2013 - [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)) goes on temp. leave from his position at NSA, citing the pretext of receiving treatment for his epilepsy. He later travels to Hong Kong and revealed he used PGP, tor, and the hosted email service La to exfiltrate huge amounts of US secrets to the press. Although he settled in Russia after that, he claims he ["destroyed his documents"](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-cesca/edward-snowden-bizarre-interview_b_5421572.html) before going to Russia.
- late 2013 - RSA Security discontinues using Dual_EC_DRBG, after revelations that RSA was paid $10 million by NSA to use the provably backdoored Dual_EC_DRBG.
- August 8, 2013 - Lavabit shut down by US mandate.
- August 9, 2013 - Silent Circle shut down by US pressure.
- September 2013 - [keybase.io](http://web.archive.org/web/20131008131612/https://keybase.io/) a [re-implementation of PGP in JavaScript](https://keybase.io/kbpgp), combined with proprietary hosted key keyserver, founded by the founders of a trendy dating website.
- April 1st, 2014 - In one of the most bizarre April-Fools-just-kidding-it's-real days of all time, [Heartbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed), a "catastrophic" OpenSSL vulnerability (and possible back-door)  was publicly revealed by Google. At the time of disclosure, some 17% (around half a million) of the Internet's secure web servers certified by trusted authorities were believed to be vulnerable to the attack.
- April 11th, 2014 - An anonymous source reports [NSA knew for at least two years](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-11/nsa-said-to-have-used-heartbleed-bug-exposing-consumers) about Heartbleed and exploited it for their own purposes.
- June 4th, 2014: [Google announces end-to-end encryption for Gmail](https://security.googleblog.com/2014/06/making-end-to-end-encryption-easier-to.html), based on GPG. Yahoo follows suit.
- August 2014: Respected cryptographer [Matthew Green](http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/08/whats-matter-with-pgp.html) blogs "It's time for PGP to die."
- October 14, 2015 - [a Gallup poll](http://www.gallup.com/poll/186167/biden-maintains-positive-image.aspx) 49% of Americans view Joe Biden (author of S.266) favorably, 37% unfavorably. Biden "regrets every day" that he didn't run for president.

## Summary

False Opposition is a powerful technique indeed.

Yes, the Good Guys have officially become the Bad Guys. Spoiler Alert. We need to "man the fuck up" and develop new shit to use in the inevitable crypto war.

What can we do? Whom do we trust when the stakes are higher than ever?

When in doubt, follow djb.
