zenbot is an automated Bitcoin trading bot for [GDAX](https://gdax.com/).

zenbot follows a couple human-made rules:

1. decisions based on net trade volume of the dominant "taker" side
2. trade only at market value

The rest of the trading strategy is based on machine-learning and historical analysis, which you can run yourself to discover better strategies. It has full console graphing/indicators to show its reasoning when making decisions.

Since zenbot discovers its own best parameters based on marked data, you don't have to be a savvy trader to use it.

- Out of the box, zenbot is an AI-powered trade advisor (gives you buy or sell signals while watching live data)
- Give it a virtual balance, and zenbot will simulate on historical data and give you an ROI figure.
- Give it some time, and zenbot will learn how to improve the ROI through tweaking the trade parameters.
- Give it an API key, and zenbot will actually perform trades!

HOWEVER. BE AWARE that once you hook up zenbot to a live exchange, the damage done is your fault, not mine!
